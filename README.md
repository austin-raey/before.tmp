# Before.tmp

Before.tmp is a NEXT.JS template repository providing a production-ready boilerplate for building web applications with a focus on a good developer experience.

While this repo is not the most minimal template, it does include a set of tools I feel are the minimal set needed to build scalable and maintainable web applications.
