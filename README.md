# Before.tmp

Before.tmp is an opinionated NEXT.JS template repository providing a production-ready boilerplate for building web applications with a focus on a good developer experience.

While this repo is not the most minimal template, it does include a set of tools I feel are the minimal set needed to build scalable and maintainable web applications. In this regard, I would still consider this a "bare bones" starter template -- as some of these tools you'd likely add anyways to enhance DX and add some code quality guardrails.

Often times, staring from a completely bare template can leave developers spending a lot of time setting up tooling and project structure instead of focusing on building features -- and there is an overwhelming amount of choices to make. I have tried to make some of those choices for you. You can start with this template and then remove or swap out tools as you see fit, or just keep it as is and start building your application right away.
